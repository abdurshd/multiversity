  historicalContext: 'Russia in 1917 was like a pressure cooker that had been building steam for decades - and then someone forgot to turn off the heat! 💥 World War I was a disaster, the Tsar was clueless, people were starving, and everyone was pretty much done with the whole "autocracy" thing. Enter Vladimir Lenin, a professional revolutionary who had been plotting in Swiss coffee shops for years, waiting for exactly this moment. What happened next was the world\'s first successful communist revolution, and it was WAY more dramatic than any movie! 🎬⚡',
