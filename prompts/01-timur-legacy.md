### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A majestic and imposing realistic oil painting of Emir Timur (Tamerlane) at the height of his power in Samarkand, 1400 AD. Timur sits on a magnificent golden throne intricately carved with Persian floral motifs and set with rubies and turquoise. He is an elderly but powerful figure, with a white beard, a wounded leg (visible limp posture even while seated), and piercing, intelligent eyes that command absolute authority. He wears a robe of the finest Chinese silk in deep crimson (#990000) embroidered with gold thread, and a helmet with a horsehair plume resting on his knee. The setting is the audience hall of the Gur-e-Amir, featuring breathtaking Islamic architecture: towering arches covered in blue and turquoise mosaic tiles (#0066CC, #40E0D0) forming complex geometric patterns (girih), marble floors reflecting the light, and silk carpets from Persia. Surrounding him are ambassadors from Spain, China, and the Ottoman Empire, bowing in respect and fear. Mongol horsemen in lamellar armor stand guard with curved scimitars, their faces weathered by the steppe wind. In the background, through a large archway, the blue ribbed dome of the Bibi-Khanym Mosque rises against a brilliant desert sunset (#FF7F50). The lighting is dramatic, with shafts of golden sunlight piercing through the intricate lattice screens (jali), illuminating dust motes and casting long, powerful shadows. The color palette is dominated by the "Timurid Blue" (turquoise and lapis), royal gold, and blood red. The painting style uses rich impasto for the textures of silk and stone, with a focus on historical accuracy in armor and architecture. The mood is one of awe-inspiring power and sophisticated brutality.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 1: The Immortal Emir (China Conquered)

### Divergence Point
Timur survives his illness in 1405, launches his invasion of Ming China, and succeeds.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A sweeping, epic oil painting depicting the Timurid conquest of Beijing in 1410. The scene captures the clash of two great civilizations. In the foreground, Timurid heavy cavalry on armored horses charge through the gates of the Forbidden City. They wear distinctive Central Asian lamellar armor and pointed helmets, wielding lances and composite bows. Timur himself rides a black stallion, looking revitalized and triumphant. The Chinese defenders in Ming dynasty armor are being overwhelmed. The architecture is a mix of the burning traditional Chinese wooden palaces (red and gold) and the encroaching blue banners of the Timurids. Smoke billows into the sky, mixing with the snow (it is winter). The Great Wall is visible in the far distance on the mountains. The lighting is the cold, harsh light of a winter morning, contrasting with the warm fires of the siege. The color palette contrasts the Ming Red (#E60000) with the Timurid Blue (#0066CC) and the white of the snow. The style is chaotic and dynamic, capturing the violence and scale of the conquest.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 2: Unified Succession (Pax Timurida)

### Divergence Point
Timur establishes a stable succession; the empire consolidates into a bureaucratic state controlling the Silk Road.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A serene and majestic oil painting showing a bustling, prosperous Samarkand in 1450, the capital of a stable Timurid Empire. The scene is the Registan Square, but more developed and grander than in reality. Scholars, merchants, and diplomats from Europe, India, and China mingle peacefully. The architecture is pristine: sparkling blue domes, towering minarets, and madrasas with intricate tile work. In the center, a grand observatory (Ulugh Beg's) stands tall, symbolizing the empire's focus on science and astronomy. Silk Road caravans laden with goods (spices, silk, porcelain) are being unloaded. The atmosphere is one of golden age prosperity and order. The lighting is warm, golden afternoon sun, bathing the city in a glow of knowledge and wealth. The color palette is rich in turquoise, gold, sandstone, and vibrant fabric colors. The style is detailed and precise, reflecting the order of the empire.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 3: The Western Campaign (Europe Invaded)

### Divergence Point
Timur turns West instead of East, invading Eastern Europe.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A dark and ominous oil painting depicting the Timurid army camping outside the walls of Vienna in 1408. The sky is filled with black smoke from burning villages. In the foreground, a pyramid of skulls (Timur's trademark) is being constructed by terrified European captives, a grim symbol of terror. Timurid horse archers patrol the snowy fields. The architecture of Vienna (Gothic spires) is visible in the distance, looking fragile against the horde. The lighting is twilight, with a blood-red moon rising, casting an eerie glow over the snow and the skulls. The color palette is dark: black, grey, blood red, and the cold blue of the snow. The style is gritty and horrific, emphasizing the brutality of the invasion.
