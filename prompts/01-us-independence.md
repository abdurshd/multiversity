### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A dramatic wide-angle shot capturing the pivotal moment of American independence, rendered in a cartoonish-realistic style with rich, vibrant colors. In the foreground, George Washington stands prominently at three-quarter angle, his hand raised toward the sky holding a furled American flag, his face showing determination and hope with slightly stylized features—strong jawline, expressive blue eyes, and a noble expression. Behind him, the Continental Congress chamber in Philadelphia glows with warm candlelight streaming through tall windows, casting dramatic golden rays across the wooden floor. Revolutionary soldiers in colonial blue uniforms stand at attention on the left, their muskets gleaming, while founding fathers in period clothing gather on the right around a table with the Declaration of Independence unfurling across it, the parchment catching the light. Through the open doors in the background, you can see the silhouette of Independence Hall against a dramatic sunset sky painted in vibrant oranges, deep purples, and warm pinks. The composition uses cinematic lighting with strong rim lighting on Washington, volumetric light beams cutting through atmospheric haze, and a rich color palette of patriotic reds, deep blues, and warm golds. Shot with a 35mm lens perspective, f/2.8 aperture for shallow depth of field, with the focus sharp on Washington while the background softly blurs. The overall mood is triumphant, hopeful, and historic, capturing the birth of a nation in a single powerful frame. Artistic style blends Pixar-level character detail with Norman Rockwell's patriotic Americana, featuring smooth gradients, subtle texture work, and dynamic composition.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 1: British Victory

### Divergence Point
Washington captured at Valley Forge (1778), Revolutionary War fails, America remains British colony until 1850s dominion status.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

An alternate history scene rendered in cartoonish-realistic style showing America under continued British rule in the early 1800s. The composition features a grand colonial square in Boston with the prominent British Union Jack flag flying high above brick government buildings adorned with royal crests and "God Save the King" banners. In the foreground, a weathered bronze statue of King George III stands on a marble pedestal, pigeons perched on his crown, while colonists in period dress walk past with resigned expressions—men in waistcoats and tricorn hats, women in long dresses and bonnets. British redcoat soldiers patrol in formation, their red uniforms bright and crisp, muskets on shoulders, maintaining order with an air of authority. On the left, a colonial merchant's shop displays goods with prices in pounds sterling, and a sign reads "By Appointment to His Majesty." On the right, a group of colonists huddle reading a proclamation about "Gradual Liberalization" posted on a wooden board, their faces showing cautious hope mixed with frustration. The architecture blends American colonial brick with British imperial grandeur—Georgian windows, royal emblems, and Union Jack bunting. The lighting is overcast with diffused daylight creating soft shadows, giving a somber, restrained atmosphere. The color palette features British imperial reds (#C8102E), royal navy blues (#012169), colonial brick browns, and muted earth tones, with Union Jack colors prominent throughout. Shot with 50mm lens perspective at eye level, capturing both the authority of British rule and the subdued spirit of the colonists. The mood is resigned but not hopeless, showing a different path where freedom came through negotiation rather than revolution. Artistic style combines Pixar's expressive character work with historical painting realism, featuring detailed textures on clothing and architecture.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 2: French America

### Divergence Point
France commits massive military forces early (1777), America becomes French protectorate until 1848 independence.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A vibrant cartoonish-realistic scene depicting America under French protectorate rule in the early 1800s Napoleonic era. The setting is a bustling New York harbor transformed into a French colonial port, with the magnificent French tricolor flag (blue, white, red vertical stripes) flying prominently from government buildings designed in French architectural style—elegant Baroque facades with ornate balconies and fleur-de-lis decorations. In the foreground, a French Governor-General in elaborate military uniform with gold braiding and a bicorne hat reviews documents at an outdoor café table, while American colonists in French-influenced fashion (men in longer coats with cravats, women in Empire-waist dresses) conduct business around him, speaking in both French and English, as indicated by bilingual street signs reading "Rue de la Liberté / Liberty Street." On the left, French soldiers in blue and white uniforms with red accents stand guard near a customs house flying the imperial eagle standard, while on the right, a schoolhouse window shows a teacher instructing children with both the French tricolor and the American flag displayed side by side, and a chalkboard showing French grammar lessons. The harbor in the background features French naval vessels with fleur-de-lis sails, trading ships unloading goods, and architecture that blends American colonial with French imperial style—mansard roofs, dormer windows, and elegant stonework. The lighting is bright Mediterranean golden hour, with warm sunlight creating long shadows and highlighting the rich colors. The color palette features French tricolor blues (#0055A4), whites, and reds (#EF4135), with golden accents (#FFD700) and colonial earth tones. Shot with a 35mm lens at a slight high angle to capture the busy harbor scene, with atmospheric perspective showing the depth. The mood is cosmopolitan, culturally blended, and prosperous—a different America shaped by French enlightenment values. Artistic style merges Pixar's lively character animation with French impressionist color sensibility, featuring rich textures and dynamic composition.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 3: Loose Confederation

### Divergence Point
Articles of Confederation never replaced (1787), weak federal government, states remain largely independent until 1850.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A cartoonish-realistic illustration showing the chaos and variety of a loosely confederated America in the 1820s. The scene is split into distinct sections representing different state sovereignties along a busy border crossing between New York and New Jersey. In the center, a border checkpoint station features two different state flags (New York's Dutch-influenced orange and blue, New Jersey's buff and blue) flying side by side from separate posts, with customs officials in different uniforms collecting tariffs from frustrated merchants whose wagons are backed up in a long line. The merchants, rendered with exaggerated but endearing frustrated expressions, gesture animatedly at the delay. On the New York side (left), architecture features Dutch Colonial influences with stepped gables and vibrant merchant shops displaying prices in "York Dollars," while well-dressed businessmen in top hats conduct trade. On the New Jersey side (right), English Colonial style buildings with simpler designs display prices in "Jersey Pounds," and farmers in more practical clothing sell agricultural goods. Each side has its own signage, currency exchange booth, and militia patrol in distinctly different uniforms—New York in blue with orange trim, New Jersey in buff with blue accents. In the background, a river divides the scene with competing bridge toll houses on each side, and various state flags flutter from different buildings creating a patchwork of regional identities. A sign in the foreground reads "Interstate Commerce Checkpoint - Duties Apply" in official script. The lighting is midday bright with clear skies, creating strong shadows that emphasize the division between states. The color palette is deliberately varied and uncoordinated, featuring multiple state colors—New York oranges (#FF6600) and blues, New Jersey buffs (#F0DC82) and blues, with no unified national aesthetic, creating visual chaos. Shot with a 40mm lens at eye level to capture the checkpoint's activity, using a busy, cluttered composition that emphasizes the inefficiency and fragmentation. The mood is frustrated but lively, showing an America that prioritizes state sovereignty over unity. Artistic style blends Pixar's expressive character animation with historical Americana, featuring rich detail and dynamic, busy composition.
