### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A powerful realistic oil painting capturing the fury and passion of the French Revolution at its peak. The composition centers on the Place de la Révolution in Paris, with the imposing guillotine silhouetted dramatically against a stormy twilight sky painted in deep purples (#7C3AED), blood reds (#DC2626), and ominous grays (#4B5563)—rendered with thick impasto technique creating textured storm clouds. In the foreground, revolutionary sans-culottes in ragged clothing rendered with photorealistic fabric tears and weathering, red Phrygian caps with authentic knit texture, and tricolor cockades raise their fists and pikes in passionate defiance. Their faces show photorealistic expressions of righteous anger and hope—determined eyes with visible emotion, strong bone structure, mouths open in revolutionary chants, individual teeth and facial hair visible, skin showing dirt and revolutionary fervor. A woman in a tattered dress with realistic fabric damage holds the French tricolor flag high, the blue (#0055A4), white, and red (#EF4135) fabric billowing dramatically with authentic cloth physics, catching golden torchlight with realistic highlights and shadows. On the left, aristocrats in elaborate 18th-century finery—powdered wigs showing individual hair strands with authentic powder texture, ornate coats with gold embroidery thread detail, silk fabric showing lustrous sheen—are led toward the guillotine by stern National Guard soldiers in blue uniforms with red and white trim, fabric showing realistic wool texture and military tailoring. Aristocrat expressions range from terror (wide eyes, pale skin, trembling) to resigned dignity (composed features despite fear)—all photorealistic. On the right, revolutionary leaders including a Robespierre-inspired figure in simple black coat with realistic wool texture and white cravat with linen weave gesture toward the crowd from a wooden platform showing wood grain and construction detail, documents of the Declaration of Rights clutched in hand with visible period typography. The iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral rises in the misty background, its Gothic spires rendered in meticulous architectural detail, barely visible through volumetric smoke from burning noble estates—realistic fire and smoke effects. Cobblestone streets show individual stone texture with mortar detail, littered with discarded aristocratic symbols—broken noble crests with carved detail, torn royal portraits showing paint texture, abandoned powdered wigs. The lighting is dramatic chiaroscuro with flickering torchlight creating dancing shadows with soft edges, volumetric smoke catching golden light (#FFD700) creating atmospheric beams, and the ominous guillotine blade glinting in the last rays of sunset with realistic metal reflections. The color palette features revolutionary tricolor—deep blue (#0055A4), pure white, and blood red (#EF4135)—alongside stormy purples, torch gold, and the dark shadows of upheaval—all applied with visible oil paint brush strokes. Shot with a dynamic 28mm wide-angle lens from a low angle to emphasize the power and scale of the revolution, with the guillotine and raised flag dominating the skyline. The mood is intense, passionate, chaotic, and transformative—capturing both the violence and idealism of revolution. Photorealistic faces with pores, wrinkles, and authentic emotions, period-accurate clothing with realistic fabric weights and historical damage, architectural details from actual Paris landmarks—all executed in vibrant, saturated oil painting medium with visible impasto technique, dramatic brush strokes, and museum-quality realism.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 1: Constitutional Monarchy Success

### Divergence Point
King Louis XVI genuinely embraces constitutional monarchy (1789), peaceful transition to constitutional government.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A bright, optimistic realistic oil painting showing a peaceful alternative French Revolution where constitutional monarchy succeeds. The setting is a grand ceremonial hall in Versailles, flooded with natural daylight streaming through tall arched windows creating volumetric god-rays with realistic light scattering. In the center, King Louis XVI, rendered with photorealistic dignified but gentle features, sits at an ornate desk with gilded ormolu detail signing constitutional documents with a golden quill showing realistic feather texture. His expression shows genuine humility and wisdom—kind eyes with subtle crow's feet, slight smile of satisfaction, no trace of traditional royal arrogance. Skin shows realistic texture and natural coloring. He wears simplified royal attire: a blue coat (#1E3A8A) with minimal gold trim showing realistic silk fabric sheen and tailoring detail, and a small crown nearby on a velvet cushion with authentic gem facets and gold metalwork. To his left, representatives of the Third Estate in simple but respectable bourgeois clothing—dark coats with realistic wool texture, waistcoats showing button and pocket detail, breeches with authentic fabric folds—stand witnessing the signing with photorealistic expressions of cautious hope and pride. Individual facial features distinct, showing various ages and backgrounds. To his right, moderate nobles in less ostentatious finery nod in agreement—reduced lace detail but still elegant fabrics, showing acceptance of compromise through body language and expressions. In the foreground, a large leather-bound constitution lies open on an elegant table with inlaid wood detail, with the words "Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen" (Rights of Man and Citizen) visible in beautiful calligraphy with visible ink texture and period script, beside the French tricolor flag (blue #0055A4, white, red #EF4135) standing beside the older royal white flag with golden fleur-de-lis embroidery—realistic fabric textures on both, representing the blend of old and new. Behind the King, Marie Antoinette in a simpler dress (no elaborate panniers, just elegant muslin showing realistic draping) watches with a supportive expression showing genuine emotional engagement—photorealistic facial features conveying hope and acceptance. Through the tall windows with authentic period glazing showing slight distortions, the gardens of Versailles are visible with citizens peacefully walking on gravel paths, and in the distance, Paris shows no smoke or unrest—church spires and buildings stand intact under clear blue skies with realistic atmospheric perspective. The floor features a beautiful pattern blending royal Bourbon motifs with republican symbols—inlaid marble showing realistic stone grain and variations. The lighting is soft, natural daylight with gentle shadows creating peaceful atmosphere, warm golden tones (#FFD700) highlighting the constitutional documents. The color palette features royal blues (#1E3A8A), constitutional gold (#FFD700), peaceful whites, and hopeful greens (#10B981), with the tricolor present but not dominant—all applied with luminous oil painting technique. Shot with a 50mm lens at a respectful mid-level angle that treats all figures with equal importance, creating a balanced composition. The mood is harmonious, hopeful, dignified, and progressive—showing revolution through evolution. Every face shows photorealistic detail with natural skin tones and authentic emotions, period furnishings rendered with meticulous accuracy, all executed in vibrant oil painting medium with visible brush strokes and rich color harmonies.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 2: Robespierre's Eternal Terror

### Divergence Point
Robespierre survives Thermidorian Reaction (1794), establishes permanent revolutionary dictatorship with perpetual Terror.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A dark, ominous realistic oil painting depicting France under Robespierre's eternal revolutionary dictatorship. DARKER ATMOSPHERE WITH VIBRANT COLORS: The setting is a shadowy Paris square during perpetual state of emergency, with an oppressive atmosphere permeating every element. Deep blacks (#000000) and dark grays (#1F2937) dominate the shadows, yet colors remain saturated and vibrant where visible—creating stark, unsettling contrast. In the foreground, the guillotine operates continuously with multiple platforms visible in assembly-line fashion, the blade catching cold moonlight (#E5E7EB) with realistic metal reflections—rendered in stark, chilling detail showing wood grain and mechanism but stylized to avoid graphic horror. Dark crimson stains (#7F1D1D) on the platform show the perpetual use. Robespierre, portrayed as a gaunt figure rendered with photorealistic detail in severe black clothing (#000000) with white cravat showing realistic linen texture, stands on an elevated platform like a judge. His face shows both conviction and paranoia—intense, unblinking eyes with visible veins and dark circles, sunken cheeks with realistic skin texture, thin lips pursed in judgment, every wrinkle and facial feature photorealistic. He holds the "List of Enemies" scroll with visible period script, fingers showing realistic anatomy and tension. Around him, the Committee of Public Safety members in dark coats (#1F2937) huddle in shadowy consultation rendered with dramatic chiaroscuro—faces partially illuminated showing suspicious expressions, whispering and pointing at citizens below with photorealistic hand gestures. In the mid-ground, citizens in drab, uniform clothing (mandated revolutionary dress in muted browns #78350F and grays #6B7280) walk with heads down, photorealistic expressions showing fear and suspicion—neighbors eyeing each other warily with realistic paranoid glances, some clutching bags ready to flee showing white knuckles, others reporting to sans-culotte police who patrol in red caps (#DC2626 vibrant despite darkness) and aggressive postures. On the left, a "Denunciation Office" building with a long line of people waiting to report suspected counter-revolutionaries—some coerced showing fear in eyes, others enthusiastically zealous with fanatical expressions, all photorealistic. On the right, propaganda posters plaster every wall showing Robespierre's stern face with slogans like "Virtue Through Terror" and "Eternal Vigilance" in stark red (#DC2626) and black typography on aged paper texture. The architecture is Paris at its most austere—beautiful Haussmann buildings now neglected with crumbling detail visible, windows shuttered with realistic wood slats, churches converted to Temples of Reason with revolutionary symbols (#DC2626 vibrant red) replacing crosses. The lighting is cold and harsh WHILE MAINTAINING COLOR VIBRANCY: pale moonlight (#F3F4F6) creating long, threatening shadows with hard edges, occasional harsh spotlights from revolutionary patrols casting dramatic pools of light, minimal warm light sources creating stark contrast—film noir atmosphere with saturated colors in lit areas. The color palette is DELIBERATELY DARK YET COLORFUL: deep blacks (#000000), dark grays (#1F2937), revolutionary reds (#DC2626) highly saturated but in darkness, cold blues (#1E40AF) in moonlight, with very little warmth—yet where colors appear they're vibrant, not desaturated. Skeletal trees line the streets rendered with realistic bark texture and bare branches. The Seine appears dark (#0F172A) and forbidding in background with realistic water reflecting moonlight. Shot with a 35mm lens at a slightly high angle looking down on the controlled populace, with Robespierre elevated creating sense of oppressive surveillance. The mood is paranoid, oppressive, fearful, and dystopian—showing the dark side of revolutionary idealism taken to extreme. Photorealistic faces showing psychological toll with dark circles, fear lines, suspicious expressions. All executed in oil painting technique with dramatic brush strokes emphasizing darkness yet maintaining vibrant color saturation where light hits—creating unsettling beauty in oppression.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 3: Girondist Victory

### Divergence Point
Moderate Girondists defeat radical Jacobins (1793), establish federal democratic republic with religious tolerance.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A bright, hopeful realistic oil painting showing France under moderate Girondist leadership, depicting a successful moderate revolution. The setting is a sunny afternoon in a Lyon city square, demonstrating the federal nature of this alternate France. In the center, a diverse assembly of regional representatives meets in an open-air Federal Congress beneath elegant canvas pavilions decorated with the tricolor (blue #0055A4, white, red #EF4135) and regional emblems rendered with authentic heraldry detail, sitting at a circular table with inlaid wood detail symbolizing equality and deliberation. The representatives wear a variety of photorealistic regional dress styles from across France—Provençal fabrics with vibrant patterns showing realistic textile detail, Breton traditional clothing with authentic embroidery, Alsatian dress with regional specifics—mixed with simple revolutionary bourgeois fashion showing tailored coats and waistcoats. On the left, a bustling free market scene shows merchants and farmers trading freely without excessive regulations, goods displayed in colorful abundance with photorealistic detail—cheeses showing realistic texture and aging, wines in bottles with glass reflections, fabrics in vibrant colors (#FF6600, #10B981, #FCD34D), and produce rendered with individual fruit and vegetable detail. Cheerful vendors call out prices with expressive faces showing genuine joy. Gold and silver coins exchange hands with realistic metallic reflections, and a sign reads "Liberté du Commerce" (Freedom of Trade) in elegant script. On the right, a beautiful church with photorealistic Romanesque architecture and open door shows people freely entering for worship—visible interior with authentic religious artwork and candles, while nearby a secular school operates with students visible through windows, and both buildings fly the tricolor flag with realistic fabric physics—demonstrating religious tolerance and secular education coexisting peacefully. In the foreground, children of various backgrounds play together in period clothing showing realistic fabric movement and childhood joy, holding small tricolor flags and regional pennants, their faces showing photorealistic innocent joy and freedom—individual features, genuine smiles, natural skin tones. A newspaper stand displays multiple publications with varied political viewpoints, showing authentic period typography—"Le Girondiste," "La Voix Fédérale," etc. The architecture blends French regional styles—Lyonnaise silk-merchant elegance with ornate balconies, Provençal warmth with terracotta roof tiles showing realistic texture, Parisian sophistication with limestone facades—creating a harmonious but diverse urban landscape. Through the street, the Rhône and Saône rivers sparkle in the background with trade boats peacefully navigating, realistic water reflections and boat details. The lighting is beautiful afternoon golden hour with warm sunlight creating welcoming shadows with soft edges, volumetric atmosphere showing pleasant weather with slight haze. The color palette features the tricolor (blue #0055A4, white, red #EF4135) as unifying elements alongside diverse regional colors—Provençal yellows (#FCD34D) and oranges (#FF6600), Breton blues and whites, Alsatian reds—creating a rich, varied but harmonious visual executed in luminous oil painting technique. Shot with a 40mm lens at eye level, capturing the democratic equality of the scene with no elevated figures of authority—everyone on the same level, balanced composition. The mood is optimistic, prosperous, diverse, and free—showing a successful middle path between monarchy and radical revolution. Every face shows photorealistic character and contentment, market goods rendered with appetizing detail, architectural elements showing regional pride—all executed in vibrant oil painting medium with visible brush strokes, impasto highlights, and rich saturated colors creating celebration of moderate democratic success.
