## 🎬 SORA 2 PROMPT (OpenAI)

### Visual Description
A stunning futuristic journey through a digital multiverse of alternate realities. The camera begins inside a sleek, holographic quantum computer core with glowing circuit pathways and flowing data streams in electric blue and neon cyan. Suddenly, the core explodes outward in a burst of digital particles, transforming into a vast neural network of branching timeline nodes—each node representing a pivotal historical decision point, rendered as glowing holographic spheres suspended in dark cyberspace. The camera flies through this digital neural web at high speed, passing historical moments displayed as advanced holographic projections: Revolutionary War soldiers rendered in wireframe blue light, French revolutionaries as pulsing red holograms, Cold War tensions shown as competing data streams in red and blue, nuclear scenarios as ominous orange threat matrices. Each historical vignette appears as a floating holographic display with futuristic HUD interfaces, timeline probability calculations scrolling in the background, and branching pathway visualizations connecting decisions to outcomes. The camera performs a dynamic swooping movement through cascading layers of these holographic timelines, with neon-lit timeline branches splitting and recombining like fiber optic cables carrying light. Digital particles stream between nodes creating rivers of luminous data. Advanced UI elements and timeline probability percentages flash across the scene. The final sequence shows all timeline branches converging in spectacular fashion—streams of neon light, digital code, and holographic fragments spiraling together to form the word "MULTIVERSITY" in massive 3D holographic letters that pulse with electric energy, surrounded by orbiting timeline nodes and flowing digital aurora effects against a backdrop of infinite black cyberspace dotted with distant data constellations.

### Style & Cinematography
Futuristic sci-fi aesthetic with cyberpunk influences; dynamic tracking shot transitioning to crane rise; 24mm lens with shallow depth of field (f/2.8); neon color grading with electric blues, cyber cyans, neon magentas, and digital oranges; volumetric lighting with holographic projections; lens flares from digital light sources; advanced particle simulations; holographic scan line effects; digital glitch transitions; UI/HUD overlay elements; 8K cinema quality

### Lighting & Mood
High-contrast lighting with neon glow illumination; electric blue and cyan as primary light sources; accent lighting in neon pink, purple, and orange; rim lighting on holographic elements; atmospheric digital haze with light beams cutting through darkness; futuristic, mind-bending, technologically awe-inspiring mood; sense of infinite digital possibilities and advanced computation

### Action/Motion
High-speed camera flight through digital neural network; smooth swooping camera movements through holographic layers; digital particle effects flowing like streams of light and data; dynamic rotation of timeline nodes and holographic displays; cascading convergence of timeline branches; pulsing energy waves emanating from central convergence point

### Audio Description
Electronic cinematic score with deep bass undertones building to epic synthesizer crescendo; digital sound design with data transmission whooshes; futuristic UI beeps and holographic activation sounds; bass drops synchronized with timeline branch splits; powerful electronic crescendo as "MULTIVERSITY" materializes; subtle quantum computing hum throughout

### Alternative Text Prompt (if JSON not supported)
**Camera positioned close-up on antique brass pocket watch floating in cosmic space, hands spinning backwards rapidly.** Wide-angle 24mm lens, f/2.8 aperture, slow-motion at 40% speed. The watch dissolves into flowing golden particles as camera begins smooth crane rise movement upward. **Historical vignettes appear as holographic, translucent layers:** Revolutionary War soldiers at crossroads, French revolutionaries in candlelit debate, figure before diverging railway tracks, nuclear missiles contrasted with peace doves, Berlin Wall fragmenting into timelines. Each scene shimmers with ethereal light and scan line effects, overlapping in cosmic space. **Camera rises 15 feet over 8 seconds**, revealing these moments as floating islands surrounded by swirling galaxies and temporal rifts. Golden particle streams flow between timelines like liquid light. Timeline branches grow upward like reverse tree roots, creating web of infinite possibilities. **Final composition:** All timeline threads converge, forming the word "MULTIVERSITY" in glowing, pulsing energy against backdrop of infinite historical possibilities. **Lighting:** Dramatic golden hour warmth (3200K) transitioning to cosmic blue tones (6500K), volumetric god rays, rim lighting on figures, atmospheric fog. **Color grading:** Cinematic with rich golds #D4AF37, deep blues #1E3A8A, ethereal purples #7C3AED. **Audio:** Orchestral score building from subtle piano to full symphony; distant historical sound echoes; temporal whooshes; ticking clock motif; powerful crescendo. (no subtitles) 8K cinema quality.

## 📝 PROMPTING NOTES

### For Sora 2
- Keep dialogue section empty or use (no subtitles)
- Emphasize camera movement explicitly
- Describe materials and physics (brass, particle flow)
- Use specific timing for 8-second constraint
- Request high resolution (8K) for quality

### For Veo 3.1
- JSON structure provides superior control
- Specify camera position explicitly ("positioned close-up on...")
- Use technical photography terms (focal length, aperture)
- Include "no subtitles" directive for cleaner output
- Color values can be hex codes for precision
- Audio description goes after colon to avoid unwanted text overlay

### For Both Platforms
- Avoid requesting copyrighted styles or brands
- Emphasize "original" and "creative" aesthetic
- Use descriptive language for abstract concepts
- Specify mood and emotion for better atmosphere
- Include specific technical details for consistency
- Request cinematic quality and 8K resolution

## 🎯 GENERATION TIPS

1. **First Generation:** Use the prompt as-is to establish baseline
2. **Iteration 1:** Adjust pacing if transitions feel rushed
3. **Iteration 2:** Fine-tune particle density and flow
4. **Iteration 3:** Refine color grading for brand consistency
5. **Final Polish:** Ensure logo reveal has maximum impact

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Too fast:** Add more slow-motion descriptors or reduce action complexity
- **Unclear timelines:** Increase holographic opacity to 70-80%
- **Weak convergence:** Emphasize energy beam intensity and glow
- **Audio mismatch:** Regenerate with more specific musical descriptors
- **Low quality:** Explicitly request 8K and maximum quality settings
