### Alternative Text Prompt (if JSON not supported)
**Camera positioned inside sleek holographic quantum computer core with glowing circuit pathways and flowing data streams in electric blue (#0EA5E9) and neon cyan (#06B6D4).** Wide-angle 24mm lens, f/2.8 aperture, dynamic motion. The quantum core explodes outward in burst of digital particles, transforming into vast neural network of branching timeline nodes—glowing holographic spheres suspended in dark cyberspace. **Camera flies at high speed through digital neural web** passing holographic historical projections: Revolutionary War soldiers in wireframe blue light, French revolutionaries as pulsing red holograms, Cold War as competing red-blue data streams, nuclear scenarios as orange threat matrices. Each vignette appears as floating holographic display with futuristic HUD interfaces, timeline probability calculations scrolling, branching pathway visualizations. **Camera performs dynamic swooping movement** through cascading holographic timeline layers. Neon-lit timeline branches split and recombine like fiber optic cables. Digital particles stream between nodes creating rivers of luminous data. Advanced UI elements and probability percentages flash across scene. **Final convergence:** All timeline branches spiral together—streams of neon light, digital code, holographic fragments forming "MULTIVERSITY" in massive 3D holographic letters pulsing with electric energy, surrounded by orbiting timeline nodes and flowing digital aurora against infinite black cyberspace with distant data constellations. **Lighting:** High-contrast with neon glow—electric blue and cyan primary, neon magenta (#EC4899) and purple (#A855F7) accents, digital orange (#F97316) threat indicators, rim lighting on holograms, volumetric digital haze. **Color grading:** Cyberpunk high-contrast with crushed blacks and neon-saturated highlights. **Audio:** Electronic score with deep bass building to synthesizer crescendo; digital whooshes; futuristic UI beeps; bass drops; quantum hum; powerful electronic climax. (no subtitles) 8K maximum quality.

## 📝 PROMPTING NOTES

### For Veo 3.1
- JSON structure provides superior control for complex futuristic effects
- Specify camera position explicitly ("positioned inside quantum core...")
- Use technical photography terms (focal length, aperture, dynamic motion)
- Include "no subtitles" directive for cleaner output
- Color values can be hex codes for precision (#0EA5E9, #EC4899, etc.)
- Audio description goes after colon to avoid unwanted text overlay
- Specify effects intensity as "maximum" for holographic and particle systems
- Emphasize "futuristic," "cyberpunk," "holographic," and "neon" aesthetic descriptors
- Use technical sci-fi language (quantum computing, neural networks, data streams)
- Specify neon color palette explicitly with hex values
- Request high-contrast lighting with crushed blacks
- Include UI/HUD overlay elements for futuristic feel
- Request cinematic quality and 8K resolution with maximum effects
- Emphasize dynamic camera movement (high-speed flight, swooping)
- Describe digital materials and physics (holographic projections, neon light flow, particle streams)

## 🎯 GENERATION TIPS

1. **First Generation:** Use the prompt as-is to establish futuristic baseline aesthetic
2. **Iteration 1:** Adjust camera speed and motion if flight feels too slow or too fast
3. **Iteration 2:** Fine-tune neon particle density, glow intensity, and holographic opacity
4. **Iteration 3:** Refine cyberpunk color grading for maximum neon saturation and contrast
5. **Iteration 4:** Enhance UI/HUD overlay elements and digital effects
6. **Final Polish:** Ensure logo convergence has maximum electric energy and impact

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Not futuristic enough:** Add more neon glow descriptors, holographic scan lines, and digital glitch effects
- **Unclear holograms:** Increase holographic opacity to 70-80% and emphasize wireframe renders
- **Weak neon effect:** Boost saturation descriptors and request "maximum neon intensity"
- **Insufficient digital elements:** Explicitly request UI overlays, HUD interfaces, and probability calculations
- **Weak convergence:** Emphasize electric arcs, neon beam intensity, and holographic fragment density
- **Audio mismatch:** Request more bass emphasis, synthesizer leads, and electronic crescendo
- **Low quality:** Explicitly request 8K, maximum quality settings, and maximum effects intensity
