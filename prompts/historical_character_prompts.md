# Stylized Semi-Realistic Image Generation Prompts

This document contains detailed prompts for generating character images in a **"Stylized Realism"** style. The goal is to strike a balance between realistic textures and a vibrant, slightly cartoonish aesthetic, ensuring the character is **instantly recognizable**.

## Global Style Guide
> **Style:** Stylized Realism / Semi-Realistic 3D Render. Think high-quality game character art (e.g., Civilization VI leaders or Fortnite cinematic style).
> **Balance:** **50% Realistic / 50% Stylized.** Realistic textures for skin and fabric, but with smoother lighting and slightly accentuated facial features to enhance likeness.
> **Color:** Vibrant, rich, and slightly saturated. Not dull or grainy.
> **Likeness:** **CRITICAL.** The character must be immediately identifiable. Emphasize their most iconic features (e.g., Lincoln's height/beard, Stalin's mustache) slightly to ensure recognition.
