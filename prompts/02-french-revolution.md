### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A powerful cartoonish-realistic scene capturing the fury and passion of the French Revolution at its peak. The composition centers on the Place de la Révolution in Paris, with the imposing guillotine silhouetted dramatically against a stormy twilight sky painted in deep purples, blood reds, and ominous grays. In the foreground, revolutionary sans-culottes in ragged clothing, red Phrygian caps, and tricolor cockades raise their fists and pikes in passionate defiance, their faces showing exaggerated but endearing expressions of righteous anger and hope—determined eyes, strong jawlines, mouths open in revolutionary chants. A woman in a tattered dress holds the French tricolor flag high, the blue, white, and red fabric billowing dramatically in the wind, catching golden light from torches. On the left, aristocrats in elaborate 18th-century finery—powdered wigs, ornate coats with gold embroidery—are led toward the guillotine by stern National Guard soldiers in blue uniforms with red and white trim, their expressions ranging from terror to resigned dignity. On the right, revolutionary leaders including a Robespierre-inspired figure in simple black coat and white cravat gestures toward the crowd from a wooden platform, documents of the Declaration of Rights clutched in hand. The iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral rises in the misty background, its Gothic spires barely visible through smoke from burning noble estates. Cobblestone streets are littered with discarded aristocratic symbols—broken noble crests, torn royal portraits, abandoned powdered wigs. The lighting is dramatic chiaroscuro with flickering torchlight creating dancing shadows, volumetric smoke catching golden light, and the ominous guillotine blade glinting in the last rays of sunset. The color palette features revolutionary tricolor—deep blue (#0055A4), pure white, and blood red (#EF4135)—alongside stormy purples, torch gold (#FFD700), and the dark shadows of upheaval. Shot with a dynamic 28mm wide-angle lens from a low angle to emphasize the power and scale of the revolution, with the guillotine and raised flag dominating the skyline. The mood is intense, passionate, chaotic, and transformative—capturing both the violence and idealism of revolution. Artistic style blends Les Misérables theatrical drama with Pixar's expressive character work, featuring rich historical detail and dynamic composition that captures movement and emotion.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 1: Constitutional Monarchy Success

### Divergence Point
King Louis XVI genuinely embraces constitutional monarchy (1789), peaceful transition to constitutional government.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A bright, optimistic cartoonish-realistic scene showing a peaceful alternative French Revolution where constitutional monarchy succeeds. The setting is a grand ceremonial hall in Versailles, flooded with natural daylight streaming through tall arched windows, creating a sense of openness and transparency. In the center, King Louis XVI, rendered with dignified but gentle features, sits at an ornate desk signing constitutional documents with a golden quill, his expression showing genuine humility and wisdom rather than the traditional royal arrogance—kind eyes, slight smile of satisfaction. He wears simplified royal attire: a blue coat with minimal gold trim and a small crown nearby on a cushion, symbolizing restrained monarchy. To his left, representatives of the Third Estate in simple but respectable bourgeois clothing—dark coats, waistcoats, breeches—stand witnessing the signing with expressions of cautious hope and pride. To his right, moderate nobles in less ostentatious finery nod in agreement, having accepted the compromise. In the foreground, a large leather-bound constitution lies open on an elegant table, with the words "Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen" (Rights of Man and Citizen) visible in beautiful calligraphy, beside the French tricolor flag (blue, white, red) standing beside the older royal white flag with golden fleur-de-lis—representing the blend of old and new. Behind the King, Marie Antoinette in a simpler dress (no elaborate panniers) watches with a supportive expression, symbolizing royal family's acceptance of change. Through the tall windows, the gardens of Versailles are visible with citizens peacefully walking, and in the distance, Paris shows no smoke or unrest—church spires and buildings stand intact under clear blue skies. The floor features a beautiful pattern blending royal motifs with republican symbols. The lighting is soft, natural daylight with gentle shadows, creating a peaceful, harmonious atmosphere. The color palette features royal blues (#1E3A8A), constitutional gold (#FFD700), peaceful whites, and hopeful greens, with the tricolor present but not dominant. Shot with a 50mm lens at a respectful mid-level angle that treats all figures with equal importance, creating a balanced composition that shows cooperation rather than conflict. The mood is harmonious, hopeful, dignified, and progressive—showing revolution through evolution. Artistic style combines the elegance of historical portraiture with Pixar's warm character design, featuring smooth gradients, detailed period interiors, and expressive faces showing genuine cooperation.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 2: Robespierre's Eternal Terror

### Divergence Point
Robespierre survives Thermidorian Reaction (1794), establishes permanent revolutionary dictatorship with perpetual Terror.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A dark, ominous cartoonish-realistic scene depicting France under Robespierre's eternal revolutionary dictatorship. The setting is a shadowy Paris square during a perpetual state of emergency, with an oppressive atmosphere permeating every element. In the foreground, the guillotine operates continuously with multiple platforms visible in assembly-line fashion, the blade catching cold moonlight—rendered in stark, chilling detail but stylized enough to avoid graphic horror. Robespierre, portrayed as a gaunt figure in severe black clothing with white cravat and intense, unblinking eyes showing both conviction and paranoia, stands on an elevated platform overlooking the scene like a judge, holding the "List of Enemies" scroll, his expression both righteous and terrifying. Around him, the Committee of Public Safety members in dark coats huddle in shadowy consultation, whispering and pointing at citizens below. In the mid-ground, citizens in drab, uniform clothing (mandated revolutionary dress) walk with heads down, expressions showing fear and suspicion—neighbors eyeing each other warily, some clutching bags ready to flee, others reporting to sans-culotte police who patrol in red caps and aggressive postures. On the left, a "Denunciation Office" building with a long line of people waiting to report suspected counter-revolutionaries, some coerced, others enthusiastically zealous. On the right, propaganda posters plaster every wall showing Robespierre's stern face with slogans like "Virtue Through Terror" and "Eternal Vigilance." The architecture is Paris at its most austere—beautiful buildings now neglected, windows shuttered, churches converted to Temples of Reason with revolutionary symbols replacing crosses. The lighting is cold and harsh: pale moonlight creating long, threatening shadows, occasional harsh spotlights from revolutionary patrols, and minimal warm light sources—creating a film noir atmosphere. The color palette is deliberately bleak: dark grays (#2D3748), revolutionary reds (#B91C1C) but desaturated, blacks, and cold blues (#1E40AF), with very little color warmth—reflecting the joy drained from French society. Skeletal trees line the streets, and the Seine appears dark and forbidding in the background. Shot with a 35mm lens at a slightly high angle looking down on the controlled populace, with Robespierre elevated, creating a sense of oppressive surveillance. The mood is paranoid, oppressive, fearful, and dystopian—showing the dark side of revolutionary idealism taken to its extreme. Artistic style blends German Expressionist shadows with Pixar's character expressiveness, featuring stark contrasts, angular compositions, and faces that show the psychological toll of perpetual terror.

## 🌍 TIMELINE 3: Girondist Victory

### Divergence Point
Moderate Girondists defeat radical Jacobins (1793), establish federal democratic republic with religious tolerance.

---

### 🎨 GEMINI PROMPT

A bright, hopeful cartoonish-realistic scene showing France under moderate Girondist leadership, depicting a successful moderate revolution. The setting is a sunny afternoon in a Lyon city square, demonstrating the federal nature of this alternate France. In the center, a diverse assembly of regional representatives meets in an open-air Federal Congress beneath elegant canvas pavilions decorated with the tricolor and regional emblems, sitting at a circular table symbolizing equality and deliberation. The representatives wear a variety of regional dress styles from across France—Provençal, Breton, Alsatian—mixed with simple revolutionary bourgeois fashion, showing cultural diversity and federalism. On the left, a bustling free market scene shows merchants and farmers trading freely without excessive regulations, goods displayed in colorful abundance—cheeses, wines, fabrics, and produce—with cheerful vendors calling out prices. Gold and silver coins exchange hands freely, and a sign reads "Liberté du Commerce" (Freedom of Trade). On the right, a beautiful church with an open door shows people freely entering for worship, while nearby a secular school operates, and both buildings fly the tricolor flag—demonstrating religious tolerance and secular education coexisting peacefully. In the foreground, children of various backgrounds play together in period clothing, holding small tricolor flags and regional pennants, their faces showing innocent joy and freedom. A newspaper stand displays multiple publications with varied political viewpoints, showing freedom of press—"Le Girondiste," "La Voix Fédérale," etc. The architecture blends French regional styles—Lyonnaise silk-merchant elegance, Provençal warmth, Parisian sophistication—creating a harmonious but diverse urban landscape. Through the street, the Rhône and Saône rivers sparkle in the background with trade boats peacefully navigating. The lighting is beautiful afternoon golden hour, with warm sunlight creating welcoming shadows, volumetric atmosphere showing the pleasant weather. The color palette features the tricolor (blue #0055A4, white, red #EF4135) as unifying elements alongside diverse regional colors—Provençal yellows and oranges, Breton blues and whites, Alsatian reds—creating a rich, varied but harmonious visual. Shot with a 40mm lens at eye level, capturing the democratic equality of the scene with no elevated figures of authority—everyone on the same level. The mood is optimistic, prosperous, diverse, and free—showing a successful middle path between monarchy and radical revolution. Artistic style combines the warmth of Impressionist paintings with Pixar's vibrant character design, featuring rich colors, detailed market scenes, and expressive happy faces showing genuine contentment and freedom.
