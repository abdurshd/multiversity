## Content Creation Guidelines

### Historical Event Documentation
Each event needs:
- **Date and duration**
- **Key participants** (political leaders, military figures, civilians)
- **Geographic location** with coordinates
- **Cause and effect relationships**
- **Alternative possibilities** that were historically close to happening
- **Long-term consequences** extending to present day
- **Visual elements** (maps, portraits, artifacts)

### Alternative Timeline Development
Each alternate timeline requires:
- **Specific divergence point** with exact date/event
- **Plausible chain of consequences** following historical logic
- **Key different events** that would have happened instead
- **Different historical figures** who would have risen to prominence
- **Geographic changes** (different borders, cities, nations)
- **Cultural and social evolution** in the alternate world
- **Technological development** differences
- **Present-day status** (2025) of this alternate world

### Visual Content Requirements
- **Historical portraits** and photographs
- **Maps showing territorial changes** over time
- **Infographics** for complex data (population, economics)
- **Reconstructed scenes** of key moments
- **Timeline graphics** and flowcharts
- **Comparative visualizations** (side-by-side worlds)
